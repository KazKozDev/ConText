# Development Plan for DeepL-like Translation Application Using Gemma 3:27B from Ollama

## 1. Project Overview

The goal is to build a translation application similar to DeepL.com, powered by the Gemma 3:27B LLM from Ollama. It will prioritize Russian-to-English, English-to-Russian, and Spanish (both directions) translations, with the potential to add more languages later. The app will run fully locally on a Mac Studio M1 Max (32GB RAM) and feature high-quality translations, language detection, text-to-speech, and a DeepL-inspired UI.

## 2. Core Features

### Translation
- High-quality translations for:
  - Russian ↔ English
  - English ↔ Spanish
  - Russian ↔ Spanish

### Additional Features
- **Language Detection**: Automatically detect Russian, English, or Spanish input
- **Text Input**: Typing or pasting text
- **Text-to-Speech**: Audio output for translated text in the target language
- **Copy & Share**: Copy or share translated text
- **Character Count**: Display input character count
- **Language Selection**: Dropdowns for source and target languages with a swap button
- **UI/UX**: Clean, minimalist interface identical to DeepL's design (light gray background, blue accents, simple layout)

## 3. Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python (for Ollama integration and API logic)
- Flask (lightweight web framework for local hosting)

### Frontend
- React.js (for a responsive, DeepL-like UI)
- Tailwind CSS (styled to match DeepL's aesthetic)

### Model
- Gemma 3:27B via Ollama (locally deployed)

### Text-to-Speech
- PyTTSX3 (local TTS library for macOS, supporting Russian, English, Spanish)

### Deployment
- Fully local on Mac Studio M1 Max

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 Backend

#### Ollama Integration
- Install Ollama on macOS and load Gemma 3:27B
- Use Python to prompt the model (e.g., "Translate this from Russian to Spanish: [text]")

#### API Endpoints
- `/translate`: Input text and target language, output translated text
- `/detect-language`: Detect Russian, English, or Spanish
- `/tts`: Generate audio for translated text

#### Preprocessing
- Support Cyrillic (Russian), Latin (English, Spanish), and special characters (e.g., ñ, ¿)

### 4.2 Frontend

#### Components
- **Input Box**: Textarea with character counter, styled like DeepL
- **Output Box**: Displays translated text, matching DeepL's output area
- **Language Selectors**: Dropdowns (Russian, English, Spanish) with a swap button, styled identically to DeepL
- **Buttons**: Translate, Copy, Share, Listen (TTS), with DeepL's blue button design

#### State Management
- React state for real-time updates

#### API Calls
- Connect to local Flask backend

### 4.3 Model Workflow

#### Translation
- Prompt Gemma 3:27B (e.g., "Translate [text] from English to Spanish")

#### Language Detection
- Use langdetect library for Russian, English, Spanish detection

#### Optimization
- Fine-tune prompts for accuracy across all three languages

## 5. Hardware Considerations

### Mac Studio M1 Max (32GB RAM)
- Gemma 3:27B will be quantized (e.g., 4-bit) to fit in 32GB RAM
- Leverage M1 Max GPU via Apple's Metal framework for faster inference
- Target latency: 1-5 seconds per translation (confirmed acceptable)

## 6. Development Plan

### 6.1 Phase 1: Setup & Research (1 week)
- Install Ollama on macOS (via Homebrew)
- Load Gemma 3:27B with 4-bit quantization and test on M1 Max
- Verify translation quality for Russian ↔ English ↔ Spanish
- Set up project (Python + React)

### 6.2 Phase 2: Backend Development (2 weeks)
- Integrate Gemma 3:27B with Ollama in Python
- Build Flask API for translation, detection, and TTS
- Optimize for M1 Max (Metal acceleration, quantized model)
- Test translations across all language pairs

### 6.3 Phase 3: Frontend Development (2 weeks)
- Design UI with React and Tailwind CSS, replicating DeepL's look:
  - Light gray background, blue buttons, clean typography
  - Input/output boxes side-by-side (like DeepL)
- Implement language selectors (Russian, English, Spanish)
- Connect to Flask API
- Ensure macOS compatibility

### 6.4 Phase 4: Text-to-Speech & Polishing (1 week)
- Integrate PyTTSX3 for local TTS (Russian, English, Spanish voices)
- Add audio playback in UI with DeepL-style "Listen" button
- Polish UI to match DeepL (e.g., hover effects, spacing)
- Test edge cases (Cyrillic, Spanish accents)

### 6.5 Phase 5: Testing & Finalization (1 week)
- Test translation accuracy (Russian ↔ English ↔ Spanish)
- Verify TTS functionality for all languages
- Optimize performance (ensure 1-5 second latency)
- Final bug fixes

## 7. Challenges & Solutions

### Memory Constraints
- 32GB RAM limits unquantized Gemma 3:27B
- **Solution**: Use 4-bit quantization, offload to GPU

### Translation Quality
- Gemma may underperform vs. DeepL's models
- **Solution**: Refine prompts, add basic post-processing (e.g., fix Spanish gender agreement)

### TTS Quality
- PyTTSX3 may lack naturalness
- **Solution**: Use macOS system voices if better quality is needed

## 8. Final Specifications
- **Languages**: Russian ↔ English, English ↔ Spanish, Russian ↔ Spanish
- **Deployment**: Fully local on Mac Studio M1 Max (32GB RAM)
- **Performance**: 1-5 second translation time (acceptable)
- **UI**: Exact replica of DeepL's design (light gray, blue buttons, minimalist)
