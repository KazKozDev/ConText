### Day 5: Dev Environment Finalization
- [ ] Set up Flask for backend: `pip install flask flask-cors`
- [ ] Install other Python dependencies:
  ```
  pip install langdetect pyttsx3 requests numpy
  ```

  ```
  npx create-react-app frontend
  cd frontend
  npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer axios
  npx tailwindcss init
  ```

  ```python
  def translate_text(text, source_lang, target_lang):
      # Connect to Ollama and prompt Gemma model
  ```
- [ ] Test translation endpoint with Postman/curl
- [ ] Implement language detection in `backend/models/detector.py`
- [ ] Create API endpoint for language detection
- [ ] Test language detection with sample texts in Russian, English, and Spanish

### Week 3: Backend Features & Optimization
